### Energy Transition

**Probability:** 25%

Accelerated global energy transition scenario with oil demand 
            peaking by 2028 and declining 50% by 2040. KSA pivots to become green hydrogen
            and renewable energy superpower, requiring massive economic restructuring....

**Key Assumptions:**
