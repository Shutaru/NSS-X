ID,Principle,Category,Source Countries,Approach,Priority,Rationale
GOV-01,Establish dedicated NSS Implementation Authority with cross-ministerial coordination power,GOVERNANCE,"UAE, South Korea",ADOPT_DIRECTLY,CRITICAL,Both UAE and Korea succeeded through strong central coordination. KSA's Vision 2030 governance provides foundation.
GOV-02,Implement tiered planning hierarchy: National > Regional > Municipal,GOVERNANCE,"Malaysia, Netherlands",ADOPT_DIRECTLY,CRITICAL,Clear hierarchy prevents conflicts and ensures alignment. Malaysia's NPP model is directly applicable.
GOV-03,Establish 5-year formal review cycles with public reporting,GOVERNANCE,"Singapore, Netherlands, Malaysia",ADOPT_DIRECTLY,HIGH,All successful countries have regular reviews. NSS 2001 failed partly due to lack of reviews.
GOV-04,Strengthen regional authority capacity while maintaining strategic alignment,GOVERNANCE,"UAE, Malaysia",ADAPT,HIGH,UAE's emirate flexibility and Malaysia's state role show benefits. KSA regions need more capacity.
MTH-01,Develop comprehensive national spatial data infrastructure,METHODOLOGY,"Singapore, Netherlands, South Korea",ADOPT_DIRECTLY,CRITICAL,All top performers have excellent data foundations. KSA has made progress but needs consolidation.
MTH-02,Implement robust scenario planning with stress testing,METHODOLOGY,"Netherlands, UAE, Singapore",ADOPT_DIRECTLY,CRITICAL,Uncertainty management essential given KSA's transformation ambition. Dutch methodology is most advanced.
MTH-03,Integrate environmental sustainability as core organizing principle,METHODOLOGY,"Netherlands, Singapore",ADOPT_DIRECTLY,CRITICAL,Water security and climate adaptation are existential for KSA. Netherlands' water management model relevant.
MTH-04,Adopt economic corridor development approach,METHODOLOGY,"UAE, Malaysia",ADAPT,HIGH,Corridors can connect giga-projects and distribute development. UAE and Malaysia show effectiveness.
IMP-01,Link spatial plan approval to budget allocation,IMPLEMENTATION,"South Korea, UAE",ADAPT,CRITICAL,Implementation requires financial backing. Korea's CNTP-budget link is effective.
IMP-02,Develop systematic infrastructure investment appraisal (MIRT-style),IMPLEMENTATION,Netherlands,ADOPT_DIRECTLY,HIGH,Avoid ad-hoc mega-project decisions. Dutch MIRT provides systematic framework.
IMP-03,Create special economic zones for regional development targeting,IMPLEMENTATION,"South Korea, UAE, Malaysia",ADOPT_DIRECTLY,HIGH,All benchmark countries use SEZs effectively. KSA has foundation but needs expansion.
IMP-04,Ensure mega-projects have explicit regional spillover requirements,IMPLEMENTATION,"Malaysia, UAE",ADAPT,HIGH,Giga-projects risk being enclaves. Malaysia's Iskandar integration provides model.
CNT-01,Water security as primary spatial organizing principle,CONTENT,Netherlands,ADAPT,CRITICAL,Netherlands organizes around water management. KSA must organize around water scarcity.
CNT-02,Define functional urban hierarchy with specialized roles,CONTENT,"South Korea, Singapore",ADOPT_DIRECTLY,HIGH,Clear city functions prevent duplication. Korea's tier system and innovation cities model relevant.
CNT-03,Integrate transport and land use planning at all scales,CONTENT,"Singapore, South Korea",ADOPT_DIRECTLY,HIGH,Singapore and Korea show transport-led development success. Critical for KSA's rail expansion.
CNT-04,Establish quantitative protected area targets with enforcement,CONTENT,"Netherlands, Malaysia",ADOPT_DIRECTLY,HIGH,KSA's 4.3% protection far below 30x30 commitment. Malaysia's Central Forest Spine shows effectiveness.
AVD-01,Avoid over-reliance on mega-projects without distributed development,IMPLEMENTATION,"UAE, Malaysia",AVOID,HIGH,UAE's inter-emirate competition and Malaysia's Forest City struggles show risks of mega-project-only approach.
AVD-02,Avoid top-down planning without local engagement,GOVERNANCE,South Korea,AVOID,MEDIUM,Korea's limited engagement contributed to Seoul concentration persistence. Local buy-in needed.
AVD-03,Avoid environmental targets without enforcement mechanisms,CONTENT,Malaysia,AVOID,HIGH,Malaysia's enforcement gaps limited environmental protection effectiveness. NSS 2001 had same issue.
