## Executive Summary

This integrated sectoral and regional spatial review analyzes 6 major 
            sectors and 13 regions to identify spatial conflicts, synergies, and corrective measures. 
            The analysis reveals critical water sustainability challenges, industrial-residential 
            conflicts, and coastal development pressures requiring immediate intervention.

### Key Findings

- 6 sectoral strategies analyzed with SAR 1700B total investment
- 13 regional diagnostics completed covering 34.9M population
- 5 conflict map layers and 5 synergy map layers generated
- CRITICAL: Agricultural water demand (89% of total) unsustainable
- Top 3 regions concentrate 96.0% of GDP
- 2 regions with critical water availability
- 10 corrective measures identified (SAR 57.8B total)

### Critical Actions Required

1. **Implement agricultural water demand reduction (40% target)**
2. **Establish industrial-residential buffer zones**
3. **Develop integrated coastal zone management**
4. **Expand protected areas to meet 30x30 commitment**
5. **Create regional economic specialization programs**

### Investment Summary

| Category | Amount (SAR Billion) |
|----------|---------------------|
| Total Corrective Measures | 57.8 |
