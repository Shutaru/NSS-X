## Executive Summary

This retrospective review analyzes 25 years of national spatial strategy 
            in Saudi Arabia, from the first NSS (2001) through the Vision 2030-aligned framework. 
            The analysis identifies key lessons learned, assesses progress against historical objectives, 
            and provides a continuity and change matrix to guide the next strategy cycle.

### Key Findings

- NSS 2001 achieved partial success: urban hierarchy established but regional balance not achieved
- Environmental targets (protected areas, water efficiency) largely unmet across both strategies
- Vision 2030 framework shows stronger implementation but concentration risk remains
- Governance mechanisms improved significantly post-2016
- 11 elements need strengthening
- 3 elements need modification
- Water security identified as critical priority requiring immediate attention

### Progress Assessment

| Strategy | Achieved | Partial | Failed/At-Risk | Total |
|----------|----------|---------|----------------|-------|
| NSS 2001 | 0 | 4 | 2 | 7 |
| NSS 2030 | 0 | 6 | 0 | 6 |

| Diversify economic base beyond oil dependency... | PARTIAL | 60.0 | 50.0 |
| Increase Saudi employment in private sector... | PARTIAL | 30.0 | 22.0 |

### Key Achievements
- Established first comprehensive spatial planning framework for KSA
- Created regional development directorates in all 13 provinces
- Developed initial GIS infrastructure for spatial planning
- Highway network expanded significantly (22,000 km added)
- New industrial cities established (Jubail expansion, Yanbu)
- Urban planning regulations modernized in major cities

### Key Failures
- Regional imbalance persisted - Riyadh's dominance increased
- Environmental protection targets largely unmet
- Water sustainability goals not achieved
- Secondary cities failed to develop as planned
- Implementation mechanisms were weak
- Monitoring and evaluation system never operationalized
- Private sector integration was minimal

### Lessons Learned
- Implementation requires dedicated institutional capacity
- Top-down planning without local buy-in has limited effectiveness
- Economic incentives must align with spatial objectives
- Environmental targets need enforcement mechanisms
- Regular monitoring and mid-course corrections are essential
- Private sector must be engaged from planning stage
- Data infrastructure is foundational for spatial planning
- Regional development needs more than infrastructure investment

## Section 3: NSS 2030 Draft Review

**Period:** 2016-2030
**Vision:** Transform Saudi Arabia into a global investment powerhouse through spatial excellence

### Objectives Assessment

| Objective | Status | Target | Current |
|-----------|--------|--------|---------|
| Establish NEOM as a new growth pole in Northwest r... | ONGOING | 1000000.0 | 50000.0 |
| Achieve 100M annual tourist visits... | ONGOING | 100.0 | 35.0 |

| Develop integrated national transport network... | ONGOING | 10000.0 | 4500.0 |
| Achieve 50% renewable energy share... | ONGOING | 50.0 | 8.0 |

### Key Strengths
- Strong political commitment and funding from PIF
- Clear alignment with Vision 2030 framework
- Ambitious giga-projects driving spatial transformation
- Better data and monitoring systems than NSS 2001
- Private sector engagement through investment funds
- International partnerships and expertise
- Youth engagement and social transformation integrated

### Key Gaps
- Over-reliance on mega-projects vs distributed development
- Environmental sustainability secondary to growth
- Water security strategy underdeveloped
- Regional inequality may increase without intervention
- Implementation capacity in non-priority regions limited
- Climate change adaptation not fully integrated
- Social infrastructure lagging physical infrastructure
